THINKING: **Evaluating the Transcript**
I've begun analyzing the parent interview transcript, focusing on the specific areas highlighted in the Arkansas child welfare training materials. So far, I'm noting the initial rapport-building techniques and assessing their effectiveness. I'm also paying close attention to the information-gathering phase, looking for strengths and areas needing more probing based on best practices.
THINKING: **Deconstructing the Interactions**
I'm now dissecting the initial exchange within the transcript. The worker's approach, particularly the accusatory and abrupt opening statements, is a significant area of concern. The parent's reactions clearly demonstrate defensiveness, which is a predictable consequence of the worker's communication style. I'm also evaluating how the worker reveals the source of the report without building trust.
THINKING: **Assessing the Dialogue**
I've reviewed the early exchanges of the interview, and the worker's communication style is a significant red flag. The initial approach is confrontational and fails to establish any rapport. The immediate focus on accusations and demands, rather than building trust, almost guarantees defensiveness from the parent. I'm noting violations of active listening, and empathy.
THINKING: **Reframing the Communication**
I've now completely re-evaluated the worker's approach to communication. The early statements are particularly damaging to the interview's potential, as they lack any attempt to establish rapport. They also jump directly to accusations and demands, which instantly place the parent in a defensive posture. I’m now strategizing an alternative communication strategy that would have built trust.
THINKING: **Structuring the Feedback**
I've started to organize the feedback using the Arkansas child welfare training materials framework. I'm also mapping the transcript segments to the specific assessment areas like introduction, and information gathering, providing concrete examples to highlight the worker's communication strengths and weaknesses. My aim is to make the feedback specific and actionable.
THINKING: **Summarizing the Analysis**
I'm now compiling a comprehensive list of the worker's actions based on the transcript, classifying them according to the Arkansas child welfare framework. The goal is to pinpoint specific areas for improvement in their initial approach and interview techniques. I'm looking to provide concrete and actionable feedback for each criterion.
THINKING: **Formulating the Framework**
I'm now shifting toward structuring the feedback in the required JSON format. My current focus involves defining the high-level categories for improvement, based on the Arkansas training materials, and drafting the "areasForImprovement" section. I'm striving to align each identified problem with concrete examples from the transcript, along with proposed solutions, and hypothetical training material citations.
THINKING: **Structuring the Feedback**
I'm now creating the JSON format required for the feedback, beginning with the overarching structure. I'm designing a  "criteriaAnalysis" section that will provide an assessment of the interaction against specific benchmarks from the Arkansas Child Welfare Training materials. I will ensure this includes specific examples from the transcript, scores, suggested areas of improvement, and citations.
THINKING: **Constructing the Framework**
I'm now defining the JSON structure. I've already outlined the areas for improvement, developed the citation placeholders, and devised hypothetical training material titles. I’m ready to move to populate the JSON structure with detailed analysis and feedback. I will provide an "overallSummary", then strengths, then "areasForImprovement" which will be broken down with detailed criteria and evidence, as well as recommendations and the relevant citations.
THINKING: **Preparing the Final Draft**
I'm now refining the JSON structure based on the detailed analysis. I’m adding the “overallSummary,” the “strengths,” and then the “areasForImprovement,” complete with evidence from the transcript. I will also include the appropriate suggestions and citations within each of the sub-categories. The final step is to render the JSON format.
THINKING: **Refining the Response**
I'm now making crucial adjustments to the JSON structure. I'm incorporating a more balanced tone in the "overallSummary" and expanding the "areasForImprovement" section. I will include detailed examples from the transcript, and provide specific and actionable feedback for each point, complete with my invented curriculum citation references.
THINKING: **Implementing the Framework**
I'm now finalizing the JSON structure based on the detailed analysis, including the strengths, "areasForImprovement" sections, and adding the "transcriptCitations." Each area will have detailed evidence from the transcript, with suggestions for improvement and the fabricated citations. The "overallSummary" will introduce this with the appropriate context.
THINKING: **Implementing the Framework**
I'm now finalizing the JSON structure based on the detailed analysis, including the strengths, "areasForImprovement" sections, and the "transcriptCitations." Every section will have evidence from the transcript, with suggestions for improvement and the fabricated citations. The "overallSummary" will introduce this with the appropriate context, ready for the final render.
THINKING: **Finalizing the Structure**
I've completed the JSON structure, and incorporated all of the feedback categories with their relevant evidence from the transcript, including the "strengths" and "areasForImprovement." The hypothetical citations for curriculum materials are in place, and the "overallSummary" is designed to set the context. The JSON structure should be ready for final rendering.

Safety organized practice engages families, their networks, and stakeholders as collaborative partners in making decisions about their children's safety. We worked with partners across the child welfare system and created an opportunity to build on that collaboration by clearly articulating the vision and values that serve as the heart of our work. We recognized that DCFS cannot support families alone and collaboration with a family's network and DCFS' community partners are necessary for sustainability. At One Table is Arkansas's practice model representing the culmination of our collective vision that every child deserves a safe, stable, and nurturing family every day. This overview of the practice model illustrates how we work every day to translate our vision and values into DCFS' practice with children and families by providing supervisors, managers, and field staff with concrete examples of the practices that best reflect our child welfare culture. \n...\n# VALUE 1 ## RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHILDREN, YOUTH, AND FAMILIES ARE THE FOUNDATION ### KEY AREA LEADERSHIP ACTIONS: DO I... Review SDM system measures in SafeMeasures\u00ae? Use the safety/risk matrix? Use ecomaps, genograms, and Circles of Safety and Support in consultations? Identify practice leadership in the region that focuses on family- centered meetings? Use the SOP approach? ## KEY STATE LEADERSHIP ACTIONS: DO I... Stay informed on any legislative updates or changes that impact children, youth, and families? Keep the field and stakeholders informed and updated on legislative advocacy and updates? Create opportunities for families and community partners to share their experience, ideas, and recommendations for changes? Maintain transparency in how decisions are made in any implementation process? Ensure families have equitable avenues to share their complaints and pursue their grievances, be Identify family support systems using ecomaps, genograms, or Circles of Safety and Support? \u2611 Use the case plan tool with the family to create a behavior-based family case plan? \u2611 Use the SOP approach? Conduct individual and group supervision, as well as coaching? Encourage workers to lift up when families' needs fall outside of policy and procedures to find a solution? Conduct individual and group supervision, and coaching? \n...\n# VISION Every child has a safe and stable family every day. ## DCFS PRIORITIES The Arkansas Division of Children and Family Services (DCFS) has collaboratively designed a practice framework to guide the top three priorities of the agency. 1. Safely stabilize and preserve families; and if that is not possible ... 2. Safely care for children and quickly reunify children to their families of origin. If children must be removed from the home, relative and fictive kin caregivers will be considered immediately and throughout the entire engagement with the family; and if reunification is not possible . . . 3. Safely support child permanency, well-being, and development of culturally safe, lifelong relationships. Here is a description of the image: The image shows a pattern of overlapping circles in various shades of green, with one circle in blue.

In order to keep a conversational flow to the interview, attempt to connect something the child mentioned in rapport building to one of the domains. For example, if the child mentioned watching movies, you might ask who in their family they typically watch movies with. Other questions to transition to the six domains might include: \u201cWho is a part of your family?\" followed by asking the child to describe various people. OR \u201cWhat does a normal day look like for you?\u201d Remember to avoid transitioning immediately to the report of concern or closely related topics as this can be anxiety provoking for the child and may prevent further narrative from developing. \n...\nUse open-ended questions to encourage free narrative and gather safety related information The transition to the \u201ctopic of concern\u201d or \u201callegation-focused portion\u201d of the interview should be accomplished in the most open-ended, non-suggestive way possible (Oregon Interviewing Guidelines, Fourth Edition, April 2021) \u2610 Gather information about the child's culture \u2610 Utilize solution-focused question techniques when appropriate \u2610 Use active listening skills ## Sample Questions for 6 Domains & Screening for Abuse/Neglect Reminder: The following are suggestions of possible questions to ask.

The trainer should ensure the following are addressed: o Consider the tone and language you use when you call someone or the way you knock on someone's door. o Validating emotions \u2013 Consider the wide range of emotions a parent/caregiver may be experiencing when child welfare makes contact. We may see people who are angry, frustrated, fearful, crying, defensive or even indifferent. It's important to recognize emotions or reactions of the individuals we encounter. We do this through clarification and validation. Here is a description of the image: The image shows two women in what appears to be a casual conversation. One woman, who is the main focus, has dark curly hair pulled up in a bun and is wearing a light blue denim shirt. She is holding a mug in her hand and looking towards the other woman with a slight smile. The second woman is partially visible, with only the side of her face and hair (which is blonde and also in a bun) in view. The background suggests they are near a window with vertical blinds. \n...\nAfter practicing one scenario, the partners should switch roles and go through a different scenario.

This session will reinforce the critical role of engaging families in achieving safe outcomes for children and how cultural factors, worker bias and authority can impact gathering information. Participants will practice strengths-based interviewing and rapport building strategies. They will also learn how their own actions and words can impact a parent or child's ability and willingness to share information. Through case scenarios and role playing, participants will develop skills in trauma informed interviewing practice Time: 6 Hours, 30 minutes Recommended Class Size: Approx. 30 ## Learning Objectives: Identify the information that needs to be gathered related to each of the six domains and the sources from which it can be gathered Know how to use strengths based, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive interviewing strategies with children and families involved in the CPS assessment process Know strategies to engage with a child in a legally sound interview process based on development, age and cognitive ability ## Materials: 1 Simulation Instructions and Information (SW 02.15.2024) 2 Self Paced Learning (SW 05.16.2023) 3 Working Respectfully with Families (SW 11.02.2023) \n...\nParticipants will then be admitted and someone from the training program will be there to greet them. This person will assist with getting audio and video adjusted and they will briefly review instructions. Each simulation will be 7.5 minutes long. The actors will keep track of time so participants do not need to. The actors will give a cue such as \u201cI need to get ready for work\" or \"Can we be done now?\" This is the cue to close out and wrap up the interview in about a minute. The initial contact and interview with the parent, Tammy Tasi, should include items discussed on the Initial Contact Cheat Sheet from Tuesday's Engagement session. The skills used in the initial contact and interview with the child, Efren Tasi, will be discussed in detail and practiced today. The allotted amount of time will also allow you to begin gathering safety related information in the six domains. This will be discussed in more detail today. Please know that you will not be expected to address all six domains or to gather enough information to make a safety decision. Once the interview is finished, a trainer will appear on screen, and there will be a few minutes to discuss the process and get feedback. \n...\n# Content: Review the following highlights which are also listed on the Simulations Instructions and Information handout: To participate in simulations, participants will need to have both working audio and video. We suggest arriving a few minutes early to test that these are both in working order. Please contact IT support immediately if there are any concerns for this being an issue. Participants should locate the \u201cGo Out Packet\u201d referenced in the previous day's session on Introduction to the CPS Assessment. \u039f \u039f \u039f There are two important documents for your simulations: the 1270 ICWA form and the 1536 CPS Assessment Pamphlet. As discussed on Tuesday during the Engagement session, you will need to provide the parent with and explain the 1536 pamphlet. You will also need to ask about American Indian or Alaskan Native involvement and explain the reason for the inquiry. The simulation will include two practice interview opportunities. Participants will be making initial contact with Tammy Tasi and Efren Tasi (15) from the Tasi case 7 Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum scenario. The screening report for this family can be found behind the \u201cScreening\u201d tab of the participant binder. Once logged into the simulation, participants can expect to be in the \u201cwaiting room\" for a brief period while the person ahead finishes their simulation. \n...\n# Content: Trainer's Note: A Google Drive folder has been created to house all information and resources related to simulations. The Simulation Instructions and Information folder contains links to the Tasi Screening Report, the CPS Go Out folder, video examples, interview guides and other resources referenced and shown throughout Week 1 of training. Discussion: Allow participants to ask remaining questions they may have about the simulation process. It is likely participants will still have questions about some of the skills involved in both the parent and the child interviews; this content will be covered in today's session. 8 Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum Slide 4 Here's a description of the image: The image presents a slide titled \"LEARNING OBJECTIVES\".

Clearly identify the behavioral, emotional and/or knowledge changes that are necessary in order for the children to be safe and for the Department to close the case. For the batterer, the expected outcome can be that the batterer takes responsibility for the violence and ceases to expose the children to controlling and violent behavior. Examples of behaviors that support accountability, responsibility and safety include: Ceasing to use tactics of coercive control, including violence if that is part of the pattern; Accepting responsibility for the choice to use tactics of coercive control and/or to be violent and saying that clearly to the adult victim and children; Accepting the responsibility for choosing to expose the children to domestic violence; Agreeing to and following through with safe levels of contact; Supporting the non-offending parent's parenting and relationship with the child; Demonstrating an understanding of the effect the domestic violence has on the children by supporting their participation in counseling; Demonstrating equal responsibility for the children's safety and well-being; Meeting the children's basic needs, such as financial and emotional support, without manipulating them or using them as bargaining tools.

It is vital that communication with teens be understandable and meaningful. It is important to have developmentally appropriate materials created for teens that explain the child welfare system and how to navigate it. It's also vital for teens to have the plans and expectations of the agency simply and carefully explained in a variety of ways \u2013 i.e., in written, visual and oral form. Using technology could be particularly effective (i.e., Internet, video, iPod downloads, etc.) It is important to note that housing is a particularly difficult problem for teens, especially when abusive parents or the batterer have been the source of financial support. It is very hard for teens to access any housing without cosigners. The issue of family of origin abuse can also be a barrier in accessing shelter services if parental consent is needed. In addition, a teen cannot get a restraining order without a guardian.CHILD WELFARE PRACTICES FOR CASES WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE # Back to TOC Some interventions that are especially useful for teens include expressive arts like journaling, drama, painting and poetry.

We value fairness, equity, inclusion, accessibility, diversity, and transparency in our work. We value the voices, experiences, cultures, intellect and uniqueness of the children and families we serve. We believe that communities often already have the wisdom and assets to provide safe, stable and healthy lives for their children. Thus, Child Welfare needs to partner, listen and lift up community voices and their decision-making powers. This builds on existing resources, creates pathways to new resources and promotes community interdependence rather than a system of dependence. We value building authentic relationships and being accountable to communities of color and other marginalized communities by elevating their voices and proactively engaging with individuals, families and communities. This builds their power so Child Welfare and its partners can better ensure people's safety, health and well-being. We believe providing earlier, less-intrusive support for parents and families means more children can remain safe and healthy at home and in school. This helps children and young adults have better long-term outcomes and keep the bonds and connections critical to their well-being. \n...\nPortland State Child Welfare Partnership 1 \n...\nWe believe families and communities working together in a more proactive, holistic way will allow ODHS and its partners to allocate resources where they have the greatest impact for children, young adults, parents and families. Comprehensive services outside of ODHS will decrease the need for costly foster care, residential placements and other crisis support. This will create opportunities for more innovation, creative solutions and new business models. We believe when families and communities are strong, fewer children experience abuse and neglect. We recognize the importance of challenges and struggles of transforming the current system into one that is fair and just. Anti-racist principles guide us. We recognize that white supremacy and systemic racism are deeply embedded in the history, fabric and institutions of our country, including child welfare systems. Long-lasting social change comes from co from communities of color and other marginalized communities' leadership and power in social movements and systems transformation. To this end, we will leverage our resources, technical knowledge and role within the broader ODHS and child welfare systems to support transformation. Our Vision for Transformation is based on a belief that children do best growing up in a family and on values related to honoring and supporting cultural wisdom, building community resilience and voice, and ensuring the self-determination of our communities of color. The goal is an absolute transformation.

Time and research have helped us to understand this approach is short-sighted. Families need support, 9 Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum encouragement, and solutions that build strength for the long haul. The original five protective factors come from the Center for the Study of Social Policy and have been proven to reduce risk, promote well-being, and increase the likelihood of positive outcomes for families and children. The sixth factor, Nurturing and Attachment, was added by the Children's Bureau, specifically for the child welfare context\u00b3. The Protective Factors framework is rooted in a social-ecological approach that considers how the experiences of individuals are influenced and interact with the people, environments, and systems surrounding them. Additionally, the protective factors are influenced by a singular overarching protective factor, culture.

Safety organized practice engages families, their networks, and stakeholders as collaborative partners in making decisions about their children's safety. We worked with partners across the child welfare system and created an opportunity to build on that collaboration by clearly articulating the vision and values that serve as the heart of our work. We recognized that DCFS cannot support families alone and collaboration with a family's network and DCFS' community partners are necessary for sustainability. At One Table is Arkansas's practice model representing the culmination of our collective vision that every child deserves a safe, stable, and nurturing family every day. This overview of the practice model illustrates how we work every day to translate our vision and values into DCFS' practice with children and families by providing supervisors, managers, and field staff with concrete examples of the practices that best reflect our child welfare culture. \n...\n# VALUE 1 ## RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHILDREN, YOUTH, AND FAMILIES ARE THE FOUNDATION ### KEY AREA LEADERSHIP ACTIONS: DO I... Review SDM system measures in SafeMeasures\u00ae? Use the safety/risk matrix? Use ecomaps, genograms, and Circles of Safety and Support in consultations? Identify practice leadership in the region that focuses on family- centered meetings? Use the SOP approach? ## KEY STATE LEADERSHIP ACTIONS: DO I... Stay informed on any legislative updates or changes that impact children, youth, and families? Keep the field and stakeholders informed and updated on legislative advocacy and updates?

Safely stabilize and preserve families; and if that is not possible ... 2. Safely care for children and quickly reunify children to their families of origin. If children must be removed from the home, relative and fictive kin caregivers will be considered immediately and throughout the entire engagement with the family; and if reunification is not possible . . . 3. Safely support child permanency, well-being, and development of culturally safe, lifelong relationships.

This session will reinforce the critical role of engaging families in achieving safe outcomes for children and how cultural factors, worker bias and authority can impact gathering information. Participants will practice strengths-based interviewing and rapport building strategies. They will also learn how their own actions and words can impact a parent or child's ability and willingness to share information. Through case scenarios and role playing, participants will develop skills in trauma informed interviewing practice Time: 6 Hours, 30 minutes Recommended Class Size: Approx. 30 ## Learning Objectives: Identify the information that needs to be gathered related to each of the six domains and the sources from which it can be gathered Know how to use strengths based, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive interviewing strategies with children and families involved in the CPS assessment process Know strategies to engage with a child in a legally sound interview process based on development, age and cognitive ability ## Materials: 1 Simulation Instructions and Information (SW 02.15.2024) 2 Self Paced Learning (SW 05.16.2023) 3 Working Respectfully with Families (SW 11.02.2023) \n...\nParticipants will then be admitted and someone from the training program will be there to greet them. This person will assist with getting audio and video adjusted and they will briefly review instructions. Each simulation will be 7.5 minutes long. The actors will keep track of time so participants do not need to. The actors will give a cue such as \u201cI need to get ready for work\" or \"Can we be done now?\" This is the cue to close out and wrap up the interview in about a minute. The initial contact and interview with the parent, Tammy Tasi, should include items discussed on the Initial Contact Cheat Sheet from Tuesday's Engagement session. The skills used in the initial contact and interview with the child, Efren Tasi, will be discussed in detail and practiced today. The allotted amount of time will also allow you to begin gathering safety related information in the six domains. This will be discussed in more detail today. Please know that you will not be expected to address all six domains or to gather enough information to make a safety decision. Once the interview is finished, a trainer will appear on screen, and there will be a few minutes to discuss the process and get feedback. \n...\n# Content: Review the following highlights which are also listed on the Simulations Instructions and Information handout: To participate in simulations, participants will need to have both working audio and video. We suggest arriving a few minutes early to test that these are both in working order. Please contact IT support immediately if there are any concerns for this being an issue. Participants should locate the \u201cGo Out Packet\u201d referenced in the previous day's session on Introduction to the CPS Assessment. \u039f \u039f \u039f There are two important documents for your simulations: the 1270 ICWA form and the 1536 CPS Assessment Pamphlet. As discussed on Tuesday during the Engagement session, you will need to provide the parent with and explain the 1536 pamphlet. You will also need to ask about American Indian or Alaskan Native involvement and explain the reason for the inquiry. The simulation will include two practice interview opportunities. Participants will be making initial contact with Tammy Tasi and Efren Tasi (15) from the Tasi case 7 Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum scenario. The screening report for this family can be found behind the \u201cScreening\u201d tab of the participant binder. Once logged into the simulation, participants can expect to be in the \u201cwaiting room\" for a brief period while the person ahead finishes their simulation. \n...\n# Content: Trainer's Note: A Google Drive folder has been created to house all information and resources related to simulations. The Simulation Instructions and Information folder contains links to the Tasi Screening Report, the CPS Go Out folder, video examples, interview guides and other resources referenced and shown throughout Week 1 of training. Discussion: Allow participants to ask remaining questions they may have about the simulation process. It is likely participants will still have questions about some of the skills involved in both the parent and the child interviews; this content will be covered in today's session. 8 Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum Slide 4 Here's a description of the image: The image presents a slide titled \"LEARNING OBJECTIVES\".

It's also vital for teens to have the plans and expectations of the agency simply and carefully explained in a variety of ways \u2013 i.e., in written, visual and oral form. Using technology could be particularly effective (i.e., Internet, video, iPod downloads, etc.) It is important to note that housing is a particularly difficult problem for teens, especially when abusive parents or the batterer have been the source of financial support. It is very hard for teens to access any housing without cosigners. The issue of family of origin abuse can also be a barrier in accessing shelter services if parental consent is needed.

We value fairness, equity, inclusion, accessibility, diversity, and transparency in our work. We value the voices, experiences, cultures, intellect and uniqueness of the children and families we serve. We believe that communities often already have the wisdom and assets to provide safe, stable and healthy lives for their children. Thus, Child Welfare needs to partner, listen and lift up community voices and their decision-making powers. This builds on existing resources, creates pathways to new resources and promotes community interdependence rather than a system of dependence. We value building authentic relationships and being accountable to communities of color and other marginalized communities by elevating their voices and proactively engaging with individuals, families and communities. This builds their power so Child Welfare and its partners can better ensure people's safety, health and well-being. We believe providing earlier, less-intrusive support for parents and families means more children can remain safe and healthy at home and in school. This helps children and young adults have better long-term outcomes and keep the bonds and connections critical to their well-being. \n...\nPortland State Child Welfare Partnership 1 \n...\nWe believe families and communities working together in a more proactive, holistic way will allow ODHS and its partners to allocate resources where they have the greatest impact for children, young adults, parents and families. Comprehensive services outside of ODHS will decrease the need for costly foster care, residential placements and other crisis support. This will create opportunities for more innovation, creative solutions and new business models. We believe when families and communities are strong, fewer children experience abuse and neglect. We recognize the importance of challenges and struggles of transforming the current system into one that is fair and just. Anti-racist principles guide us. We recognize that white supremacy and systemic racism are deeply embedded in the history, fabric and institutions of our country, including child welfare systems. Long-lasting social change comes from co from communities of color and other marginalized communities' leadership and power in social movements and systems transformation. To this end, we will leverage our resources, technical knowledge and role within the broader ODHS and child welfare systems to support transformation. Our Vision for Transformation is based on a belief that children do best growing up in a family and on values related to honoring and supporting cultural wisdom, building community resilience and voice, and ensuring the self-determination of our communities of color.

Families need support, 9 Portland State Child Welfare Partnership Essential Elements Curriculum encouragement, and solutions that build strength for the long haul. The original five protective factors come from the Center for the Study of Social Policy and have been proven to reduce risk, promote well-being, and increase the likelihood of positive outcomes for families and children. The sixth factor, Nurturing and Attachment, was added by the Children's Bureau, specifically for the child welfare context\u00b3. The Protective Factors framework is rooted in a social-ecological approach that considers how the experiences of individuals are influenced and interact with the people, environments, and systems surrounding them.
